# Comparison of Heterogenous and Homogenous Ensemble Methods
In this paper I compare the successes of homogeneous and heterogeneous ensembles in the context of breast tumor classification. To ensure sufficient diversity between members of the homogenous ensemble, I have implemented bootstrap aggregation techniques (Bagging), to train each member on a different subset of datapoints from the training dataset. The heterogeneous ensemble is composed from sufficiently diverse classification members, including: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Trees. Model tuning is accomplished via a gridsearch of the parameter space, for both ensemble methods.
